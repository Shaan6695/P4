            <p class="reviewCard-full">TrackMania is a series of racing games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo DS and Wii developed by Nadeo and Firebrand Games. Instead of following the usual trend of choosing a set car and track to play the game, in TrackMania the players can create their own tracks using a "building block" process. <br> <br> I like this game because it is a very simple and easy to get into game. The competition is extremely high for those who want to compete and for those that just want to relax and enjoy casually, they can do that too. It is fun to just watch as well and see the best players in the world go and see who can get the fastest time on the tracks. It makes for some really fun stories to tell! <br> Click<a href=" "> <mark class="hereblue">Here </mark></a>for more info </p>

            <p class="reviewCard-full"> <br> In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

            <p class="reviewCard-preview">&nbsp; Fortnite is a free-to-play Battle Royale game with numerous game modes for every type of game player. Watch a concert, build an island or fight.  </p>
            <p class="reviewCard-full"> <br> In Fortnite Battle Royale, hop off the Battle Bus to the Island below and battle it out to be the last one standing. Or team up with friends or other players to outlast other teams. Use the power of wood, brick, and metal to build structures to help you out. There’s always something to look forward to in Fortnite Battle Royale, including new items, weapons, vehicles, modes, special events, and “Seasons.” Each new Season brings a distinct theme to the Island.

            <p class="reviewCard-preview">&nbsp; Sony Interactive Entertainment, Insomniac Games, and Marvel have teamed up to create an authentic Spider-Man adventure. This isn’t the Spider-Man you’ve met or ever seen before. This is an experienced Peter Parker who’s more masterful at fighting big crime in Marvel's New York. At the same time, he’s struggling to balance his chaotic personal life and career while the fate of millions of New Yorkers rest upon his shoulders. </p>
            <p class="reviewCard-full"> <br> After eight years behind the mask, Peter Parker is a crime-fighting expert. Feel the full power of a more experienced Spider-Man with improvisational combat, dynamic acrobatics, fluid urban traversal, and environmental interactions. A rookie no longer, this is the most masterful Spider-Man you’ve ever played.
