            <p class="reviewCard-full">The DUALSHOCK Wireless Controller for PS4 gives you what you want in your gaming from precision control over your games to sharing your greatest gameplay moments with your friends while providing easy recharging so you are always ready. What I like about this controller is that over all of the the good console controllers I have used this one has been very comfortable to hold and play with. I can play in a regular position and another position of holding the controller known as "Claw" which I find easiest to do on the ps4 controller. I took one apart once and found it to be and very interesting to see what is inside of it and how it operates. <br> Click<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualshock4-wireless-controller-for-ps4-jet-black.3001538"> <mark class="hereblue">Here </mark></a>for more info

            <p class="reviewCard-full">Competitive shooters are best played with a mouse and keyboard since they allow faster aiming and shortcut keys. Many point-and-click games, MOBAs, and MMO games are also better with a mouse and keyboard because they require flexible keybinds and precise cursor movements.<br> <br> I like a good Keyboard and Mouse setup because in some games it is easier to use these compared to using a controller. I enjoy being good at both of them as it gives me well-roundedness and I enjoy learning from keyboard, mouse and controllers. It takes skill to use them both and is rewarding when you do well using these peripherals.

A gaming laptop means high speed, huge memory, better graphics, and fast processing power. <br> <br> I Really enjoy using gaming laptops because of its portability which is one of the main reasons people get them. You can take it anywhere you want, althought they typically do not have the best battery life because of the crazy high amount of power they are carrying in a smaller frame, it is still very useful. I like the fact that I can play video games anywhere around my house and not limited to just one room.
